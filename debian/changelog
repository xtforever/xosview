  * Moved the Xdefaults out of /usr/share/doc to leave only one instance
    in /etc/x11/app-defaults - What were they doing there in the first
    place?
  * Added the .stipple XDefaults to the end of the main file, documented
    it in the man page

xosview (1.8.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt so dh_installmenu puts the menu in /usr/share/menu instead
    of /usr/lib/menu
  * Changed float to double in various meters as to prevent numbers over
    2^32 (now common in RAM on large systems) from becoming wrong

xosview (1.8.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed: lmstemp didn't show the right information - Thanks to Robert
    Schueler for the (obvious) patch, excuse me for not dealing with it
    earlier! (Closes: #183695)
  * Fixed: Now properly deals with the absence of a battery without
    spitting out loads of errors. Attila Kinali's hint was in the right
    direction, only I prefered to do something about the errors.

xosview (1.8.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

xosview (1.8.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuild with modern debhelper (closes: #177464)

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Tue,  9 Apr 2002 00:58:58 -0500

xosview (1.8.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Removed root test on clean (not required)
  * Only remove rpath when $host_os is linux*, and make the modification
    in config/configure.in, not configure
  * Rebuild configure from configure.in in the configure stage and remove
    it on clean.
  * Remove linux/memstat/Makefile on clean
  * Updated watch file for new upstream location
  * Revert the "using namespace std;" from linux/netmeter.cc and the
    "std::hex" from serialmeter.cc.  These appear to be no longer
    necessary for g++-3.0 compiles.  I'm sure the hppa folks will tell me
    if I'm wrong.
  * Changed the transparency code to the simpler form used by Tim van
    Erven <tripudium@chello.nl>; this fixes the badpixmap error given when
    xosview is compiled with gcc-3.0 and transparency is turned on.
  * Applied (a slightly modified) patch from Helge Deller <deller@gmx.de>
    to increase the buffer size allocated for reading /proc/stat.  On hppa
    (PA-RISC) /proc/stat has very long lines, since there are virtualized
    interrupts, and xosview will hang on startup if the information in
    /proc/stat is larger than the buffer (closes: #141706)
  * Added a README.cvs for people who end up wanting to make a debian
    package directly out of a cvs version.  As of this release, we are now
    synchronized with upstream cvs.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sun,  7 Apr 2002 23:49:50 -0500

xosview (1.8.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * All patches seem to have been reapplied successfully to new upstream
    version 1.8.0.
  * Remove all autogenerated targets on clean
  * Force the use of g++-3.0.  This should help make sure that any further
    changes don't break architectures without g++-2.95
  * Updated debian/copyright to reflect new upstream location at
    SourceForge

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sun, 17 Mar 2002 16:06:25 -0600

xosview (1.7.3-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Officially fix the C++ bug in Xrm.h (thanks to Jérôme Marant for the
    NMU while my dev box was toasted) (closes: #133658)

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sat,  2 Mar 2002 19:14:21 -0600

xosview (1.7.3-11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add "using namespace std;" to linux/netmeter.cc, which should fix up
    the last build problem on hppa (I hope) (closes: #132889)

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Mon, 11 Feb 2002 14:43:24 -0600

xosview (1.7.3-10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Undocumented fixes from the 3.1 NMU reinstated:
    * s/friend XWin/friend class Xwin/ in xwin.h
    * ia64, hppa, arm, mips (and alpha, but that was already taken care
      of) cannot deal with ioperm, so exclude them in
      linux/serialmeter.cc.
    * use std::hex instead of hex in serialmeter.cc
  * The above changes mean that arm and mips can actually compile
    serialmeter.cc, so remove the ugly hack used in 1.7.3-9.
  * The ioperm changes should fix compilation on mips (closes: #117297),
    and the C++ changes should fix hppa (closes: #126469).

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Feb 2002 18:19:06 -0600

xosview (1.7.3-9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Nasty hack in config/Makefile.linux.in to test for the presence of
    "arm" inside of @host_cpu@, and if found, set $(ARCH) to arm,
    otherwise set $(ARCH) to @host_cpu@, and then test $(ARCH) against
    $(FAIL_ARCH).  This closes: #117297 again, but means that any future
    hardware that returns "arm" as a substring of its @host_cpu@ result
    will not have a serialmeter.  This may be just as well.  Thanks to
    willy in #debian-devel for the suggestion.
  * Add s390 to the list, while we're at it (closes: 127469)
  * Add powerpc to the list (Thanks to Andrew Sharp, but next time could
    you please use the bug system?  I almost lost your e-mail...)
  * If we add too many more architectures to the list, it might get easier
    simply to list the architectures that DO have ioperm() and serialmeter
    support.
  * Tim van Erven's patch to add transparancy looks fairly safe, so I'm
    adding it.  (closes: #127549)
  * Remove config.cache and config.status in clean target.
  * Medium urgency, since it fixes building on three architectures.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Tue, 22 Jan 2002 19:08:58 -0600

xosview (1.7.3-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add arm to FAIL_ARCH list in config/Makefile.linux.in.  This wasn't a
    lost portability patch, arm simply had never been added to the list.
    (closes: #117297)

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Fri,  2 Nov 2001 18:29:34 -0600

xosview (1.7.3-7) unstable; urgency=low

xosview (1.7.3-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update config.guess and config.sub; this fixes builds on several

xosview (1.7.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Section: utils instead of x11
  * Removed debugging message in intmeter.cc left in the -4 patch
  * Added xlibs-dev to Build-Depends (closes: #112941)

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Sep 2001 17:30:25 -0500

xosview (1.7.3-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "It's Not Quite A Year Late" release.
  * Removed the dune-chemicals.txt from the config directory.  Amazing
    what strange things can get copied into the wrong directories and yet
    remain unnoticed.
  * Patches from Massimo Dal Zotto:
    * Added -hmargin, -vmargin and -vspacing options to allow more precise
      control of widget geometry when swallowed by gnome-panel.
      * (I modified this patch to use the typesafe MIN and MAX macros that
        Linus approved for the 2.4.10 Linux kernel, just because I like
        them, and did minor cosmetic changes --Zed)
    * Changed defresources.awk to generate a human readable version of
      defresources.cc.
    * Discarded the IRQ patch in favor of the one from David Fries.
  * Applied patch from David Fries <dfries@mail.win.org> to set irqs_ and
    lastirqs_ at run time (closes: #108738)
  * Corrected xosview*networkBandwidth -> xosview*netBandwidth in the
    manpage (closes: #109491)
  * Added a "Monitoring" hint element to the xosview menu entry.  I am
    somewhat wary of this, since I know of no other menu entries also
    using that hint, but it seems to be a reasonable category to create,
    so I might as well be the first.  (closes: #82549)
  * Copy across /usr/share/automake/config.{guess,sub} to fix breakage on
    arm and hppa.  Thanks to LaMont Jones <lamont@debian.org> for the NMU
    on this earlier. (closes: #96549, #105032)
  * DH_COMPAT=3.
  * Standards-Version 3.5.6; moved the binary to /usr/bin, the manpage to
    /usr/share/man/man1 (and put it back to .1 from .1x); Build-Depends
    added for debhelper.  I've probably missed others, but the
    autobuilders will file bugs, I'm sure.
  * Removed the *BSD specific README files.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Sep 2001 19:15:08 -0500

xosview (1.7.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Quickie change to move /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults to
    /etc/X11/app-defaults.
  * Massimo Dal Zotto: I haven't forgotten about your patches; I just
    haven't had time to finish putting them in and testing them, so
    they're completely left out of this upload.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Dec 2000 23:42:06 -0600

xosview (1.7.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the manpage reference to loadAlarmThreshold so that it now
    correctly uses loadWarnThreshold.  I've sent a note about this
    upstream, along with a comment about 2 being too low for a default
    value. (closes: #60178)
  * The xosview binary is no longer compiled with -R (rpath) set.  I
    patched configure directly to do this, pending a discussion with
    upstream, so don't rebuild it with autoconf.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Apr 2000 13:36:46 -0500

xosview (1.7.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * The upstream CHANGES file notes that the negative numbers cosmetic bug
    has been fixed, so this might fix bug #19019 finally.

xosview (1.7.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

    no longer needed.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Aug 1999 11:33:51 -0500

xosview (1.7.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Okay, so it really does have to be XOsview...
  * Bumped the standards version (required updating the references to the
    licenses) while I was at it.
  * Fixed the ungzipped CHANGES file problem, which stemmed from
    dh_compress not behaving as I expected (not sure if that's a bug yet),
    and not paying attention the last time I updated.  Lintian would have
    caught it if I'd checked, naughty naughty...  Fixes bug#41983.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sat, 14 Aug 1999 17:28:43 -0500

xosview (1.7.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the rules file to copy the xdefaults file as Xosview rather than
    Xdefaults.  I'm leaving it however as Xosview rather than XOsview
    unless someone has a compelling reason to do it otherwise.  Thanks to
    Marcus Jodorf <m@bogomips.de> for pointing it out.  Closes bug#40557.

xosview (1.7.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified the mc68k patch to make use of @host_cpu@ and to also allow
    for the addition of sparc to the exclusion list (thanks to Christian
    Meder <meder@isr.uni-stuttgart.de> for a patch for this).  This should
    close bug #33231.  At this point the original mc68000 patch has been
    sent upstream (and been included for the next official release), but
    this new patch has not.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Jun 1999 12:35:25 -0500

xosview (1.7.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the mc68000 patch, which apparantly partially failed on one
    file.  Should be working now.  Should fix bugs #24324, #28930,
    #37851.  The sparc patch isn't in yet.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Mon, 17 May 1999 13:55:34 -0500

xosview (1.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  This should work with kernels > 2.2.1.
  * The __mc68000__ and __KERNEL__ patches were reapplied, since I've been
    bad and haven't sent these patches upstream yet.  I'll get to it RSN.
  * Turned off memstat to get the thing to compile on my system.  Thank
    Joey Hess for prompting me to putz with it again long enough to figure
    out that this was responsible.  This release seems to fix bugs #33795,
    #34511, #35796, #37462.  I'm going to have to talk to the Alpha and
    M68k people again for some of the other bugs, though.

xosview (1.6.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use "#ifdef __mc68000__", not "#ifdef __mc68k__ in MeterMaker.cc.
    This should *really* fix bug#24324, I hope.
  * Added a "#define __KERNEL__" to linux/memstat/memstat-2.0.c to work
    around odd compile problems on m68k platforms (fixes bug#28930)
  * Thanks to Roman Hodek for help getting the above together.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Thu, 10 Dec 1998 01:13:25 -0600

xosview (1.6.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Integrated a variant of the patch sent by Frank Neumann
    <Frank.Neumann@Informatik.Uni-Oldenburg.DE> that fixes the m68k
    compilation problems due to the lack of an ioperm() call on m68k
    platforms.  Someone with an m68k please test this and let me know
    if it works (I changed the MeterMaker.cc patch so that it didn't
    assume you had an i386 if you didn't have an m68k, but I'm not sure if
    I did it correctly).  If this works, it fixes bug#24324.
